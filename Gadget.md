`**` Your MD5 password is NOT your normal password. To find your MD5 password, return to MyEpisodes.com. Log in and go to the [MyEpisodes.com Control Panel](http://www.myepisodes.com/cp.php). Copy your MD5 hashed password and paste it into the form.

### Switch feed types ###
Select the 'menu' icon in the lower right of the gadget to choose from the available feed types. Switching the feed causes the gadget to refresh (it does not refresh Google Calendar though) and displays the selected feed.

From this menu you are also able to view the raw XML from MyEpisodes.com by clicking the 'View Feed XML' menu item. This will view the raw XML for the currently selected feed. If you wish to view the raw XML of a different feed, select that feed first before selecting the 'View Feed XML' menu item.

You can also log out of the gadget which sends you back to the [login screen](Gadget#Gadget_Login.md).
